Hi, I'm Rajeev Lochan, a dedicated Computer Science and Engineering student at IIIT Sri City, deeply fascinated by the intersection of systems engineering, intelligent automation, and secure computation.
I love building scalable and high-performance systems that merge algorithms, distributed architectures, and AI-driven decision-making.

My work spans from backend engineering and video streaming architectures
 — such as tokenized HLS with adaptive bitrate delivery and FFmpeg-based multi-resolution transcoding — to advanced research in cryptography and zero-knowledge proofs (ZKPs).

Beyond development, I enjoy diving deep into operating system concepts, computer networks, and theory of computation, often experimenting with low-level tools like unistd.h and kernel-space programming.

When I’m not coding, I explore how blockchain consensus, zkSNARKs, and decentralized file storage systems enable secure, verifiable computation. I’m currently learning to design end-to-end secure distributed systems that balance efficiency, privacy, and scalability.
